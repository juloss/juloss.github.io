The goal of this project is to investigate a new approach to shape matching. In short, our objective is to compare two contours, **C1** and **C2**, both of which can be curves (open or closed). **C1** is a template we want to match in an imageâ€”here, it is a hand-drawn contour. **C2** is a contour extracted from an image by an automated process. In this example, we use the [Segment Anything Model (SAM)](https://segment-anything.com) to obtain a mask, and then simply use OpenCV to trace a contour around that mask. 

Below is an example of this approach:

Full process:
![Stop sign]({{ page.image1 }}){:.centered}{:width="100%"}

Zoomed in so we can see the matches more clearly:
![Stop sign]({{ page.image2 }}){:.centered}{:width="100%"}
