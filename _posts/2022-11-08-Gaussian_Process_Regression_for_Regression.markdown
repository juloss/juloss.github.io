## Simple Intuition

Assume that we h
Let's suppose that we have regression problem and the underlying unknown function we want to learn is $$f : \mathbf{R} \rightarrow \mathbf{R}$$ . If we do not have any training data, we cannot make sensible predictions, so we might as well just always output $$0$$. So let's assume that initially our predicion function is the constant zero function. Assume now that we get a data point at $$x_0 = 1$$ and the corresponding real output is $$y_0 = 2$$.

Recall that in regression, we are given an input $$x$$ and we want to compute a corresponding real number 
Let's assume we have a single
